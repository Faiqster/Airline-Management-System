# Airline Management System

Welcome to our demonstration of the Airline Management System, a desktop application developed using Java! This project tackles the essential challenge of managing airline operations efficiently. Hereâ€™s a brief overview of what this system offers:

## Project Overview

This Airline Management System showcases robust object-oriented programming (OOP) principles. It features a user-friendly interface combined with core functionalities for managing flights, bookings, and passenger details, utilizing Java Swing, AWT, and JCalendar.

## Key Features

- **Flight Management**: Add, modify, and delete flight schedules efficiently.
- **Booking System**: Facilitate reservations, cancellations, and booking queries.
- **Passenger Management**: Maintain and update passenger records.
- **Date Handling**: Utilize JDateChooser for intuitive date selection.
- **Data Storage**: Implement text file-based storage for seamless data persistence.

## Skills Used

- **Java Programming**: Core language for application development.
- **Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)**: Design using encapsulation, inheritance, and polymorphism.
- **Java Swing**: Building interactive GUI components.
- **AWT (Abstract Window Toolkit)**: Additional GUI functionality.
- **JCalendar (JDateChooser)**: Date selection functionality.
- **File I/O**: Handling text file-based data storage and retrieval.

## Outcome

This project highlights our proficiency in OOP principles, software design, and desktop application development. It demonstrates our ability to build and manage comprehensive systems with a clean and maintainable codebase.
